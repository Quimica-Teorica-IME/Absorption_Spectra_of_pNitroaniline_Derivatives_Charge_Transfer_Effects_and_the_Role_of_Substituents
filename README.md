In this repository, you will find the singlet ground state (S0) geometries of unsubstituted and substituted p-nitroaniline (pNA). Electron-donor (C6H5, CCH, CH3, NH2, OCH3, and OH,) and acceptor (Br, CCl3, CF3, Cl, CN, COOH, F, NO2, and SO2H) substituents were examined. S0 optimizations were carried out employing CAM-B3LYP//def2-TZVPD using the Gaussian09 program, and with the RI-MP2//def2-TZVPD implemented in the Turbomole v6.6 program.

By using the CAM-B3LYP//def2-TZVPD optimized geometries, ten gas-phase vertical singlet excited states were computed using the ADC(2)//def2-TZVPD Turbomole, and the CAM-B3LYP//def2-TZVPD using Gaussian09. These data were also included.

It also contains two Excel files respectively with the NTO and CT parameters (TheoDORE.xlsx) and the spectral data, both theoretical and experimental (Substituents.xlsx) of the aforementioned systems.

We hope our work will help you in any way possible and feel free to contact us.

From the Theoretical Chemistry Group at the Military Institute of Engineering (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), we wish you all the best.
